## Tasks

### DAY 1

#### Task 1 
Write down the possible features in Report card management system (RMS). Think out of box for any possible feature. 

###### Detailed steps :
1. Check out the GitHub repo
2. Direct check-in to master is not allowed, so create a branch in format `users_<Github user Id>_task` e.g for me it will be `users_ajay109458_createFeatureSuggestion`
3. Now there is a FeatureSuggestion folder create an md file in format `<your name>.md` ( learn to write md file) about possible features in the attendance management system. 
4. Push you changes and raise a PR.

Expected learning - Github basic commands and how to write md files.

#### Task 2
Select MVP features to keep application simplistic so that everyone has an efficient learning and new students can refer it in future for learning.

### DAY 2

#### Task 1
Think of the entities in the system.

#### Task 2
UML and Sequence diagram of the application.

#### Task 3
Flow diagrams of the different flow in the application. 

### DAY 3 - Day 6

- Proper documenation for every contribution towards the project.

### DAY 7

#### Task 1
Demo of the application. 

#### Task 2

- Share the learning during the application
- Share your experience. 

## Expected Learning
- Gather features of the application.
- Design an application. 
- Learn to work with a team.
- No fear to learn new technology anytime.  

Feel free to share you suggestions.
